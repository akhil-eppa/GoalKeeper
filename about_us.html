        <h1>About GoalKeeper</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
                GoalKeeper was founded to address a growing problem 
                related to the decrease in attention span, due to which
                we often fall short of achieving the goals and targets
                we set for ourselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our purpose is to allow everyone to improve themselves 
                by setting time-bound goals and habits and help them 
                to go about achieving them.

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
                How does one usually set goals? 
                By remembering them by the back of their heads? 
                By writing them on a piece of paper that t
                hey may not refer to again? 
                Then forgetting about all this and hence forget the goals that one had set for themselves?
                <br><br>
                Setting goals and pursuing them with a one hundred percent effort while keeping 
                track of them has always been a difficult affair.<br><br> Then came GoalKeeper.
